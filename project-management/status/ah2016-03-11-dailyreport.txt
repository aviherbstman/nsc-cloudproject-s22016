1)  I began am pretty much finished work on update tag page.  Index page has search box
    and has submit button.  Js Activity is updated to submit tag info to header. 
 

2) Continuing to work on updating the js activity to send the information into
   header still need to grab the file name to send with the tags. 

3 Struggling to figure out how to grab the file name...was able to grab the file url
  and place into the value of the text box to be sent.  
  Not at all sure how to integrate twitter oAth login and token into our project.
